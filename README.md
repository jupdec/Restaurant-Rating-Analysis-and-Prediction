# Restaurant Rating Analysis and Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing the factors which play a critical role in making the restaurant business a success. Through this effort I have tried to answer questions such as, does the demography of the restaurant matter, is understanding the people of the locality important, will the theme of the restaurant have a impact on its business, and many more.
